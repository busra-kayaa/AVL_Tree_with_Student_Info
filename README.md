"This repository contains a C implementation of an AVL tree for the Data Structures course. It manages student records (student number, name, surname, age) and supports operations like insertion with balancing, deletion with rotations, and tree traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder). Additional functions include subtree node counting, finding minimum and maximum values within a subtree, and displaying leaf nodes of the tree."
